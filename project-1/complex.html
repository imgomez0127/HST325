// "access the data in the column whose header (first entry) is 'something here'."
// So to adapt this to another dataset, you must know the column heads, and find
// the places in the template below to change it to your own column headings.

//Here is where you should put the data files, in csv format.
//You can use more than one, as an array, just give it a different number (arrays count from 0, 1, 2, etc.)

/*  This creates a new choropleth visualization. Choropleths are maps where the data is shown by shading a geographical unit on the map, 
    e.g., a state, zip code, region, etc. These regions are defined in the GeoJSON file. The code below is used to tell D3 which regions
    in the GeoJSON file correspond to which parts of the data file, and then determine the behavior (e.g., what color to make them).

    In the sample GeoJSON file (nyc_zipcodes.json), the shape objects don't have useful data by default, so when we declare the map above,
    we have a function run that makes the id predictable (in this example, "id_"+ the zipcode). For a new map, you may have to examine the
    raw GeoJSON code to see how it is set up (they all differ a bit).

    In the sample data file (nyc_zips.csv), there is also a field that corresponds to the zipcode, and then other data we can use
    for setting the color coding.

    Below, we set id_field to a function that will tell, for exact row of the data file, what shape id in the GeoJSON file it corresponds to.
    Once that is set, it's as before to set color fields, mouseover captions, etc.

/* Three examples of FILTERS are shown below. Filters parse the data based on different criteria.
 If the filter returns "true" (finds the thing it is looking for) then it applies the "found" class to objects of whatever class you tell it to.
 If the filter returns "false" (does not find what it is looking for), then it applies the "lacks" class to the same.
 By specifying the behavior of these classes in the CSS, you determine whether the filter hides or shows data.
